##  How computer works**
Computer sciences explore how to design a thinking machine . They relaised that it had to perform four different tasks :

*   **Input** The stuff that you do that make computer do stuff
*   **Storage** Information stores in memory
*   **Processing** Takes information then change it
*   **Output** Computer display many things



**In 20th century,computers were built big and slow**


##  Binary number system 

*   Computers work on (Ones and zeros)
*   Inside computers,there are electric wires and circuits that carry        information


**In order to process information that comes as input and to make it output, computer needs to modify and combine the input signal**


**Milling machines are using to create 3D objects**


**To display each letter,a computer runs thousands of instructions**


**The cpu is the master chip that controls all parts of computer**
