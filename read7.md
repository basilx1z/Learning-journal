#   Programming with Java

 **Learning to program with JavaScript involves:**

* Understanding some basic programming concepts that JavaScript programmers use to

#   Examples of JavaScript in the browser

Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

**Access** the content of the page
