#   Colors

##  Introduction :

**The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**

**Rgb values**
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. 

 **Hex codes**
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign.

**Color names**
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers

**There is another way to specify colors called HSLA.**


#   Background Color


CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names 


#   Understanding Color


Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).

When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture.

The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television scree

We have also used the padding
property to separate the text
from the edges of the boxes.
