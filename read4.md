#   Target Audience: individuals

● What is the age range of your target audience?
● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● Which country do your visitors live in?
● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● What is the average income of visitors?
● What level of education do they have?
● What is their marital or family status?
● What is their occupation?
● How many hours do they work per week?
● How often do they use the web?
● What kind of device do they use to access the web


#   Why People Visit YOUR Website

Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.
To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:
1: The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.
2: The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.
These are the triggers making
them come to the site now.

##  Specific Goals

● Do they want general
information / research (such
as background on a topic /
company), or are they after
something specific (such as a
particular fact or information
on a product)?
● Are they already familiar with
the service or product that
you offer or do they need to
be introduced to it?

#   What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

First you want to create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site. You can
then assign the list of tasks to
the fictional visitors you created



# New Html5 layout elements

The point of creating these
new elements is so that web
page authors can use them to
help describe the structure of
the page. For example, screen
reader software might allow
users to ignore headers and
footers and get straight to
the content. Similarly, search
engines might place more
weight on the content in an
<article> element than that
in the <header> or <footer>
elements. I think you will agree
that it also makes the code
easier to follow.


**HTML 4**

With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5
(which have been highlighted),
the elements you have seen in
this book were all available in
HTML 4

#   XHTML 1.0

● Every element needed a
closing tag (except for empty
elements such as <img />).
● Attribute names had to be in
lowercase.
● All attributes required a value,
and all values were to be
placed in double quotes.
● Deprecated elements should
no longer be used.
● Every element that was
opened inside another
element should be closed
inside that same element.

#   HTML5

In HTML5, web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced.

Despite the fact that HTML5
is not yet completed, you can
safely take advantage of the
new features of the language as
long as you endeavour to ensure
that users with older browsers
will be able to view your pages
(even though some of the extra
features will not be visible to
them)
