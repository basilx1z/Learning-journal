
**Version controlling** : 
-   System that allows your to revisit varsions of file or set of files by reording changes
-   We can with it comparing old version with the new one and finding misktakes .

**Local Version Control**
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

**Centralized Version Control**
-   This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients

-   allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

**Distributed Version Control**

-   addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure 
*(If it goes downn,collaborators cannot work together or save new files and versions)*

-   For some accidents like losing information , DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories .

**Snapshots**
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit 

**Local Operations**
-   This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk
-   and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

**Tracking Changes**
Git can find corruption files or information wasn't transfered correctly


##  States

**Committed** : *Data is safety stored*
 **Modified** : *If file has been changed it won't be commited into data base*
 **Staged**   : *Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot*
